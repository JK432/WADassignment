        <div id="inner_header">Forgotten Fighters</div>
        <div id="inner_zero">In today's fast-moving world and tough competitive day-to-day life, the youth hardly find time for remembrance of our
        rich heritage and past. This becomes most crucial whilst the nation celebrates Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav (commemoration of
        75 years of Indian Independence). The fight against colonial rule in India constitutes a unique narrative, one which is
        not marred by violence. Rather a narrative that is full of variegated stories of valor, bravery, Satyagraha, dedication,
        and sacrifice across the length and breadth of the subcontinent. These stories compose the rich Indian cultural heritage
        and traditions. Thus, the unsung heroes need not necessarily define the lesser-known freedom fighters. They may, at
        times, be the leaders whose ideals delineate the Indian value system.
        
        The Section on Unsung Heroes is an attempt to recall and remember forgotten heroes of our freedom struggle, many of whom
        might be renowned yet unknown to the new generation. The aim of recreating and bringing forth stories, which lay as
        faded memories of the past, shall serve as a medium of inspiration and encouragement for the coming generations. India
        2.0 is not just about fuelling the spirit of India in any one particular paradigm of growth. It encompasses all spheres
        of life, most of all by enriching our hearts and souls. The spirit of India is incomplete whilst we take our unsung
        heroes along this journey of growth and development. Their ethos and principles ought to be recalled and respected.</div>

    <div id="front_first"><a href="first.html"><div id="first_header">Subhash Chandra Bose</div></a>
        
        <div id="inner_front">Subhash Chandra Bose was one of India’s greatest freedom fighter. He revived the Indian National Army, popularly known
        as ‘Azad Hind Fauj’ in 1943 which was initially formed in 1942 by Rash Behari Bose. He had visited London during
        pre-independence period to discuss the future of India, with the members of the Labor party. His sudden disappearance
        from Taiwan, led to surfacing of various theories, unfortunately none of which were investigated thoroughly by
        successive governments; leaving people in the dark about one of the most beloved leaders India has ever produced.
        Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January, 1897 in Cuttack (Orissa) to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi. Janakinath
        Bose was one of the successful lawyer in Cuttack and received the title of “Rai Bahadur”. He, later became a member of
        the Bengal Legislative Council.
        
        He was a very intelligent and sincere student but never had much interest in sports. He passed his B.A. in Philosophy
        from the Presidency College in Calcutta. He was strongly influenced by Swami Vivekananda’s teachings and was known for
        his patriotic zeal as a student. He also adored Vivekananda as his spiritual Guru.

        <a href="second.html"><div id="first_header">Alluri Sitarama Raju</div></a>
        
        <div id="inner_front">Alluri Sitarama Raju  was an Indian revolutionary, who waged an armed campaign
        against the British colonial rule in India. Born in present-day Andhra Pradesh, India; he was involved in opposing the
        British in response to the 1882 Madras Forest Act, which restricted the free movement of Adivasis in their forest
        habitats, and prevented them from practicing their traditional form of agriculture called podu. Rising discontent
        towards the British led to the Rampa Rebellion of 1922 — in which Alluri played a major role as leader. Mustering forces
        combined of Adivasis, farmers and other sympathizers to the cause, he engaged in guerilla campaigns against the British
        authorities in the border regions of then Madras Presidency, now parts of East Godavari and Visakhapatnam. He was given
        the epithet — "Manyam Veerudu" (transl. Hero of the Jungle), by the local villagers for his heroic exploits.
        Harnessing widespread discontent towards the British colonial rule in the backdrop of the non-cooperation movement,
        Alluri led his forces against the British, aiming to expel them from the Eastern Ghats region through his guerilla
        campaigns. During this period, he led numerous raids on local police stations to acquire firearms for his under-equipped
        forces. After each raid, he would leave behind a letter written by him, informing the police about the details of his
        raids, including about the weaponry he parted away with, daring them to stop him if they can.</div>

        <a href="third.html"><div id="first_header">Matangini Hazra</div></a>

    
        <div id="inner_front">Not much is known of her early life apart from that she was born in the small village of Hogla, near Tamluk in 1869, and
        that because she was the daughter of a poor peasant, she did not receive a formal education. She was married early
        (at the age of 12) and became widowed at the age of eighteen without bearing any offspring.
        
        She became actively interested in the Indian independence movement as a Gandhian. A notable feature of the freedom
        struggle in Midnapore was the participation of women. In 1930, she took part in the Civil Disobedience movement and
        was arrested for breaking the Salt Act. She was promptly released, but then participated in the 'Chowkidari Tax Bandha'
        (abolition of chowkidari tax) movement and while marching towards the court building chanting slogan to protest against
        the illegal constitution of a court by the governor to punish those who participated in the movement, Matangini was
        arrested again. She was sentenced to six months imprisonment and sent to Baharampur jail. Again, she was incarcerated
        for six months at Baharampur.[2] After being released, she became an active member of the Indian National Congress and
        took to spinning her own Khadi. In 1933, she attended the subdivisional Congress conference at Serampore and was injured
        in the ensuing baton charge by the police.</div>
