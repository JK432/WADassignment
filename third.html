        <div id="inner_front">Not much is known of her early life apart from that she was born in the small village of
            Hogla, near Tamluk in 1869, and
            that because she was the daughter of a poor peasant, she did not receive a formal education. She was married
            early
            (at the age of 12) and became widowed at the age of eighteen without bearing any offspring.
    
            She became actively interested in the Indian independence movement as a Gandhian. A notable feature of the
            freedom
            struggle in Midnapore was the participation of women. In 1930, she took part in the Civil Disobedience movement
            and
            was arrested for breaking the Salt Act. She was promptly released, but then participated in the 'Chowkidari Tax
            Bandha'
            (abolition of chowkidari tax) movement and while marching towards the court building chanting slogan to protest
            against
            the illegal constitution of a court by the governor to punish those who participated in the movement, Matangini
            was
            arrested again. She was sentenced to six months imprisonment and sent to Baharampur jail. Again, she was
            incarcerated
            for six months at Baharampur.[2] After being released, she became an active member of the Indian National
            Congress and
            took to spinning her own Khadi. In 1933, she attended the subdivisional Congress conference at Serampore and was
            injured
            in the ensuing baton charge by the police.</div>

        <div id="insiderem">Matangini Hazra was an Indian revolutionary who participated in the Indian independence movement until she was shot dead
        by the British Indian police in front of the Tamluk Police Station on 29 September 1942. She was affectionately known as
        Gandhi buri, Bengali for old lady Gandhi.
        
        In 1905, she became actively interested in the Indian independence movement as a Gandhian. A notable feature of the
        freedom struggle in Midnapore was the participation of women. In 1932, she took part in the Non-Cooperation Movement and
        was arrested for breaking the Salt Act. She was promptly released but protested for the abolition of the tax. Arrested
        again, she was incarcerated for six months at Baharampur. After being released, she became an active member of the
        Indian National Congress and took to spinning her own Khadi. In 1933, she also attended the subdivisional Congress
        conference at Serampore and was injured in the ensuing baton charge by the police.



        West Bengal, India – 29 Sept 2019: Matangini Hazra was born in a poor household in the Tamluk district, who died today
        in 1942. Fondly remembered as ‘Gandhi Buri’ or old lady of Gandhi, Hazra was shot dead by the British police as she
        stepped forward to appeal against open firing by the policemen.
        
        Born to a poor household, she was married early to a 60-year-old widower Trilochon Hazra, only to be a widow at 18. Her
        affair with the freedom fight began at 35 years of age when she joined the independence movement and became a Gandhi
        follower.
        
        Matangini’s humble beginnings
        Born as Matangini Maity in 1870 in Penury in Hogla village located under the jurisdiction of Tamluk Police station in
        Medinapore, she could not even pursue early education. The abject poverty compelled her to become a child bride and a
        mother of a young son. She returned to her village when she was 18 years old, widowed, and childless.
        
        Hazra then began building her separate establishment in her paternal village and spent most of her time helping old and
        diseased around her house. At that point, little did she know that how her future would pen her as an unsung women hero
        of freedom struggle.
        Matangini’s active interest in the freedom struggle spiralled in 1905, drawing inspiration from none other than Gandhi.
        As per the documents, the freedom struggle in Medinapore was characterized by the huge women participation.
        
        However, the turning point in her life came on January 26, 1932, known as Indian Independence Day in those days. The
        village men marched into an awareness procession about the then political scenario, and Hazra joined the group at 62.
        Since then, there was no looking back for her.

        There is no doubt that Matangini Hazra was an ardent Gandhi follower. She joined the freedom struggle after being
        inspired by Mahatma himself. Like him, she declined all foreign goods and spun her yarn. People often recalled her for
        the humanitarian work in the village.
        
        Her vigorous participation in Mahatma Gandhi’s Civil Disobedience Movement made her infamous in the police barracks,
        especially her role in the Salt Satyagraha movement. She made salt in the Alinan salt-making factory. Alinan is her
        late’s husband village. It led to her arrest, and people watched a fragile old woman walking several miles without a
        single frown on her face. She was promptly released.
        
        Gandhi Buri in Bengali translates to the old lady Gandhi. The local people used to call her old lady Gandhi due to her
        dedication to following the Gandhian principles of freedom struggle. Her arrest could not deter her from contributing to
        the freedom struggle.
        
        Strong and gritty like Gandhi
        Like Mahatma Gandhi, Hazra’s fragile body could not deter her from participating in the freedom struggle. She was also a
        local voice against the British atrocities. Soon after her arrest, Matangini Hazra participated in the abolition of the
        Chowkidari tax- a tax enforced on villagers by the British to fund a small local group of policemen to be used as spies
        against the villagers.
        
        Following her release, Hazra started to spin Khadi as a sign of protest despite failing eyesight. During the outbreak of
        the smallpox epidemic, she had tirelessly nursed the victims, including the children.
        
        Matangini was also grievously injured in the police baton charge in 1933 while attending the sub-divisional conference
        of the Indian National Congress. She received severe blows and was hurt in the process.
        
        Her protest style was similar to Gandhi and his motto of non-violence freedom struggle to attain real freedom. Later in
        1933, during the visit of the then Governor of Bengal Sir John Anderson, she managed to breach the security and reach
        the dais to raise the black flag as a symbol of protest. The British government rewarded her with six months
        imprisonment.
        
        Matangini Hazra’s Supreme Sacrifice
        In 1942 August, the local Congress workers planned to protest near various police stations and government offices in the
        Medinapore district under the leadership of 73-year-old Matangini Hazra.
        
        On September 29, she led around six thousand protesters, mostly women, to besiege the Tamluk police station. The police
        tried to stop the procession, citing Sec. 144 of IPC. But the defiant Hazra stepped forward, appealing to the policemen
        not to open fire. In return, she was shot at arm but kept moving forward with the flag held high.
        
        The next bullet was fired, and it hit her in the forehead taking her life. Later her body was found lying in the pool of
        blood, holding the flag high, unsoiled.Kolkata: Mamata Banerjee’s loss in Nandigram, a constituency in the East Medinipur district against BJP’s Suvendu
        Adhikari in the last poll makes the bypoll even more important than the 2021 state legislature election. Banerjee has to
        win the bypoll from her home constituency, Bhabanipur, to continue as Bengal Chief Minister.
        
        This peculiar situation has led BJP to run a seamless star-studded campaign in the Bhabanipur constituency, accusing CM
        of the city’s civic problems like waterlogging. On the other hand, TMC is running an anti-BJP campaign based on farmer’s
        strikes, fuel price hikes, and the misgovernance of the central government.
        
        Here is a list of issues that will make the most noise in the bypoll.
        
        Local civic issues in Bhabanipur battle
        The recent burst of non-stop rains in the city has proved to be a boon for the opposition. Parts of the city are still
        clogged with muddy waters. Around two days ago, Banerjee had to cancel her street corner due to waterlogging. Kolkata
        Municipal Corporation officials are reasoning the situation against the shadow of heavy rains that have choked the
        city’s drainage system. The ponds and the drains are filled to their brim.

        Matangini Hazra was an extraordinary woman and an Indian revolutionary who was devoted to the cause of the country’s
        freedom from British rule. Like the Mahatma, her frail body did not deter her from being an inspiring force in the
        freedom movement, and she was so influenced by Gandhiji’s beliefs, that she earned the name “Gandhi Buri” (the old
        Gandhian woman).
        
        Little is known about Matangini Hazra’s early life, except that she was born in the village of Hogla, near Tamluk (in
        the current state of West Bengal), in 1869, and she did not acquire a formal education as she was the daughter of a poor
        peasant. She was married off young but became a widow at the age of eighteen. She then returned to her village and
        devoted her time and energy to helping people in her community. In the early 1900s, the Nationalist movement began to
        gain momentum across the subcontinent, as Gandhiji himself crisscrossed across the region, raising awareness and
        inspiring the countrymen to join the freedom fight. In 1905, Midnapore’s Gandhi Buri became actively involved in the
        Indian independence struggle. It is said that the participation of women in the liberation struggle from this region was
        significant.
        
        She participated in the Non-Cooperation movement in 1932 and was arrested for her role in the Salt Satyagraha movement.
        Though she was quickly released, she persisted with the demand that the Salt Tax be repealed. She was arrested again and
        imprisoned in Baharampur for six months. In 1933, she was hurt in a police baton charge after attending a subdivisional
        Congress convention in Serampore. Such was her determination that she remained resolute in her fight despite her
        incarceration numerous times.
        Hazra has been described as a passionate supporter of independence. In an incident that dates back to 1933, where one
        afternoon in the scorching heat, Hazra was part of a freedom march that was held in the district capital. Its
        destination was the palace of the Governor, who himself stood resolutely on his balcony, observing the march
        dispassionately, as though it were a cricket match or some native ritual going on. Matangini marched in the parade’s
        vanguard, holding the freedom flag high. As they approached closer to the Governor’s balcony, she suddenly broke through
        the cordon, evading the soldiers and brandishing her banner, shouting, “Go back, Laat Sahib”. Hazra was beaten up by
        British police for this daring act and severely injured.
        Her fearlessness and spirited actions were at the forefront when on 29 September 1942, 73-year-old Hazra led a large
        procession of around 6,000 protesters, mostly women, to take over the Tamluk police station from British authorities.
        The police tried to stop the march, and amidst the mayhem that ensued Hazra appealed to the police force to refrain from
        shooting at the protestors. Her pleas went unheard, and she was brazenly shot at thrice. She continued marching till she
        collapsed and died.
        
        Hazra’s martyrdom did not go in vain. Her contribution to the country's freedom, to which she dedicated her entire life,
        has not been forgotten. She was the first woman revolutionary to have her statue erected in the Kolkata Maidan in 1977.
        As a tribute, several schools, neighbourhoods, and roads, including a significant stretch called the Hazra Road in
        Kolkata, have been named after her. Matangini Hazra was one of those women from a humble background who has left her
        footprints in the annals of India’s freedom struggle.
