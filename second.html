        <div id="inner_front">Alluri Sitarama Raju was an Indian revolutionary, who waged an armed campaign
            against the British colonial rule in India. Born in present-day Andhra Pradesh, India; he was involved in
            opposing the
            British in response to the 1882 Madras Forest Act, which restricted the free movement of Adivasis in their
            forest
            habitats, and prevented them from practicing their traditional form of agriculture called podu. Rising
            discontent
            towards the British led to the Rampa Rebellion of 1922 — in which Alluri played a major role as leader.
            Mustering forces
            combined of Adivasis, farmers and other sympathizers to the cause, he engaged in guerilla campaigns against the
            British
            authorities in the border regions of then Madras Presidency, now parts of East Godavari and Visakhapatnam. He
            was given
            the epithet — "Manyam Veerudu" (transl. Hero of the Jungle), by the local villagers for his heroic exploits.
            Harnessing widespread discontent towards the British colonial rule in the backdrop of the non-cooperation
            movement,
            Alluri led his forces against the British, aiming to expel them from the Eastern Ghats region through his
            guerilla
            campaigns. During this period, he led numerous raids on local police stations to acquire firearms for his
            under-equipped
            forces. After each raid, he would leave behind a letter written by him, informing the police about the details
            of his
            raids, including about the weaponry he parted away with, daring them to stop him if they can.</div>

        <div id="insiderem">The monk who was pained by the woes of tribal people At the age of 18, Alluri Sitarama Raju renounced all worldly
        pleasures and became a sanyasi (monk). He roamed the hills and forests as a monk and mingled with the tribal communities
        and came to know about their difficulties and hardships. Alluri travelled to various places in the country, including
        Gangotri and Nasik. During his travels, he met the revolutionaries in Chittagong (now in present-day Bangladesh) and
        witnessed the terrible socio-economic hardships of the tribal communities who were in a miserable state due to the
        atrocities of the British administration in this country. At that time, the Christian missionaries were converting the
        tribal people to Christianity by the lure of special privileges or forces, leading them to abandon their traditional
        culture and heritage. It annoyed Alluri and he saw the aggressive conversion campaign of the missionaries as a tool to
        expand British imperialism in the country. Initially, he was influenced by the Non-cooperation Movement of Mahatma
        Gandhi and urged the tribals to seek justice in the local panchayat courts and boycott the colonial courts. However,
        these steps did not alleviate their suffering and eventually, he realised that a movement was needed for the upliftment
        of the lives of the tribal people. The preparation of Alluri Sitarama Raju Alluri settled down in the Papi hills near
        Godavari district, an area with a high density of tribal populations and initially practised various spiritual
        disciplines to gain moral stature and spiritual power. To increase his mental strength, he lived an austere life among
        the tribal people. Soon, the tribals had started to consider him a mystic, a messiah, a reputation that was bolstered
        both by myths he created about himself and by his acceptance of ones about him that were established by others,
        including those concerning his reputed invincibility. He began to educate the tribals about their rights and prepared
        them for a fight against the oppression and tyranny of the administration. He travelled the forest terrains extensively
        and gained immense geographical knowledge. Around this time, when the British authorities confiscated their ancestral
        properties, the Koya tribal brothers, Mallam Dora and Ghantam Dora, who were freedom fighters, joined the ranks of Raju
        and became his lieutenants. Alluri Sitarama Raju and the Rampa rebellion In August 1922, he launched the now famous and
        much-applauded Rampa rebellion against the British. The Rampa administrative area was home to about 28,000 tribes, who
        followed the 'Podu' system of cultivation, whereby every year some amounts of forest tracts were cleared for
        agriculture. It was their only source of food, and the tribes needed the forests to survive. On the other hand, the
        Britishers wanted to evict the tribal people so that they could exploit the forests for wood, which would eventually
        help in building their railways and ships. To clear the forests and gain total control over them, 'The Madras Forest
        Act, 1882' was passed. It restricted the free movement of the tribal communities and prohibited them from engaging in
        their traditional Podu agricultural system. And it forced the tribals to revolt. They refused to work as forced labour
        in the construction of roads and railway lines in the hilly region, and Alluri demanded justice for them. Aided by his
        excellent knowledge of the terrain, he used the tactics of guerrilla warfare to fight against the British. Leading an
        army of tribal people, Alluri attacked and raided several police stations. His army killed numerous British officers and
        captured arms and ammunition. During these raids, Alluri was ably supported by Aggi Raju, his trusted assistant. Alluri
        was the undisputed leader of the tribal communities who united under his guidance to end British oppression. His
        popularity among the common people enabled him to successfully evade the British for a long time. His two-year armed
        struggle (1922-24) against the British frustrated the authorities so much that a reward of Rs 10,000 was announced for
        anyone who could capture him dead or alive. To suppress the rebellion, the British authority began to torture the
        tribals in every way possible. They burnt villages, destroyed crops, killed cattle and violated women, but could not
        break the back of the rebellion. According to the website 'Indian Culture' of the Union Ministry of Culture, the extreme
        torture of the tribal people by the British pained Alluri Sitarama Raju, and he surrendered, expecting a fair trial in
        return. But on May 7, 1924, he was treacherously trapped, tied to a tree, shot dead and cremated on the next day. The
        legacy of Alluri Sitarama Raju Alluri Sitarama Raju has left behind an inspiring legacy of anti-imperialist rebellion.
        He left his mark in history as a fearless revolutionary, who fought for the rights and freedom of the tribal people. For
        his bravery and courage, he was honoured with the title, "Manyam Veerudu" (Hero of the Jungle). Even the British
        government acknowledged his heroics, and Mahatma Gandhi said, "Though I do not approve of his armed rebellion, I pay my
        homage to his bravery and sacrifice." The first Prime Minister of Independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru said, "Raju was
        one of those few heroes that could be counted on fingers." Legendary freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose said
        that Alluri had a fierce determination, and his unparalleled courage and sacrifice for people would make him immortal in
        history. Every year, the Andhra Pradesh government commemorates his birth date, July 4, as a state festival. In 2022,
        the state government carved out a new district named after Alluri from the erstwhile Visakhapatnam district, with Paderu
        as its headquarters.
